Starting in January of 2024, I will be the Professor of Data Science for the Common Good at the Hertie School.\nI previously worked on the Adaptive Experimentation team at Facebook Core Data Science in New York.\nMy research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and causal inference. I work a lot on experimental design and I think hard about how experimentation can be better and more efficient. I’m also interested in better applying the machinery of machine learning to observational causal inference.\nI’m most interested in methodological research useful for the study of social phenomena."
